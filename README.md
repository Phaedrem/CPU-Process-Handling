# CPU-Process-Handling

This code is meant to lightly mimic the way PC's perform process management on a single thread CPU. The code is meant to simulate the lifecycle of a process as it moves from various states such as creation, waiting, ready, running, and terminated. This was designed as an introduction to this process management and doesn't completely replicate it accurately.
